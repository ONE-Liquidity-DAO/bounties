# Bounties
The bounty program is to help the community take part in the development of the Harmony blockchain and Hummingbot codebase. It covers from core features to validator tooling, from dApp development to DeFi integration, and from DEX integration to novelty trading strategies.

Both technical or non-technical bounties can be added.
